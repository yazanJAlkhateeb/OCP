    /*LocalDate     Contains just a date—no time and no time zone. A good example of
LocalDate is your birthday this year. It is your birthday for a full day, regardless of what
time it is.
LocalTime     Contains just a time—no date and no time zone. A good example of
LocalTime is midnight. It is midnight at the same time every day.
LocalDateTime     Contains both a date and time but no time zone. A good example of
LocalDateTime is “the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve.” Midnight on January 2 isn’t
nearly as special, making the date relatively unimportant, and clearly an hour after midnight
isn’t as special either.
ZonedDateTime     Contains a date, time, and time zone. A good example of ZonedDateTime
is “a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EST.” If you live in California, you’ll have to get up really
early since the call is at 6:00 a.m. local time!

    /*Java uses T to separate the date
and time when converting LocalDateTime to a String*/
    //LocalDate d = new LocalDate(); // DOES NOT COMPILE

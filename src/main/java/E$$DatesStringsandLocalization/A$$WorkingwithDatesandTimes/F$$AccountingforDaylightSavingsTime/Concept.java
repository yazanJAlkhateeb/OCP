from 1:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. and so on. When we change our
clocks in March, time springs forward from 1:59 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. Technically it is 1:59
a.m. and 59 seconds plus milliseconds; in other words, the moment immediately before 2:00
a.m. Luckily, the exam doesnâ€™t get that granular, and we can think of it as simply 1:59 a.m*/

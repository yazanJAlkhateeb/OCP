public class Concept {
/*Internationalization is the process of designing your program so it can be adapted. This
involves placing strings in a property file and using classes like DateFormat so that the right
format is used based on user preferences. You do not actually need to support more than
one language or country to internationalize the program. Internationalization just means
that you can.

Localization means actually supporting multiple locales. Oracle defines a locale as “a
specific geographical, political, or cultural region.” You can think of a locale as being like
a language and country pairing. Localization includes translating strings to different lan-
guages. It also includes outputting dates and numbers in the correct format for that locale.
You can go through the localization process many times in the same application as you add
more languages and countries.*/

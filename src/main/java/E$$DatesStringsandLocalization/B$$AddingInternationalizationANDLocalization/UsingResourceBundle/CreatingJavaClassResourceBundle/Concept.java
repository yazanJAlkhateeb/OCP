    /*To implement a resource bundle in Java, you create a class with the same name that you
would use for a property file. Only the extension is different. Since we have a Java object,
the file must be a .java file rather than a .properties file.*/

   // There are two main advantages of using a Java class instead of a property file for a
   // resource bundle:
  //■ ■ You can use a value type that is not a String .
  //■ ■ You can create the values of the properties at runtime.

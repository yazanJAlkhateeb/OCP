    Like the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes, the FileReader and
FileWriter classes contain read() and write() methods, respectively

   These methods
read/write char values instead of byte values;

although similar to what you saw with
streams, the API actually uses an int value to hold the data so that -1 can be returned if
the end of the file is detected.

The Writer class, which FileWriter inherits from, offers a write(String) method that
allows a String object to be written directly to the stream. Using FileReader also allows
you to pair it with BufferedReader in order to use the very convenient readLine() method

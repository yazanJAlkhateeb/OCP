    /*   The most basic of the print-based methods is print() , which is overloaded with all
       Java primitives as well as String and Object . In general, these methods perform
   String.valueOf() on the argument and call the underlying streamâ€™s write() method,
       although they also handle character encoding automatically. For example, the following
       sets of print / write code are equivalent:*/

        out.print(5); // PrintWriter method
        out.write(String.valueOf(5)); // Writer method
        out.print(2.0); // PrintWriter method
        out.write(String.valueOf(2.0)); // Writer method
        Animal animal = new Animal("",5,'c');
        out.print(animal); // PrintWriter method
        out.write(animal == null ? "null" : animal.toString()); // Writer method

The process of converting an in-memory

converting stored data into an object, which is known as deserialization

/*
This serialVersionUID is stored with the serialized object and assists during the deseri-
alization process. The serialization process uses the serialVersionUID to identify uniquely
a version of the class. That way, it knows whether the serialized data for an object will
match the instance variable in the current version of the class

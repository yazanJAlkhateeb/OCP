    /*
    The java.io API defines two sets of classes for reading and writing streams: those with
Stream in their name and those with Reader / Writer in their name. For example, the
java.io API defines both a FileInputStream class as well as a FileReader class, both of
which define a stream that reads a file. The difference between the two classes is based on
how the stream is read or written.
Differences between Streams and Readers/Writers
1. 	 The stream classes are used for inputting and outputting all types of binary or byte
data.
2. 	 The reader and writer classes are used for inputting and outputting only character and
String data.
It is important to remember that even though readers/writers do not contain the word
Stream in their class name,they are still in fact streams
! The use of Reader / Writer in the
name is just to distinguish them from byte streams. Throughout the chapter, we will often
refer to Reader / Writer classes as streams, since conceptually they are streams.

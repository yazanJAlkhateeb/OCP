public class WhyUseCharacterStreams {

    /*
    Since the byte stream classes can be used to input and output all types of binary data,
including strings, it naturally follows that you can write all of your code to use the byte
stream classes, never really needing the character stream classes.
There are advantages, though, to using the reader/writer classes, as they are specifically
focused on managing character and string data. For example, you can use a Writer class
to output a String value to a file without necessarily having to worry about the


 underlying byte encoding of the file.



For this reason, the character stream classes are sometimes referred to as convenience
classes for working with text data.

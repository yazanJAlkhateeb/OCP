    Review of java.io Class Properties

A class with the word InputStream or OutputStream in its name is used for reading or
writing binary data, respectively.

A class with the word Reader or Writer in its name is used for reading or writing
character or string data, respectively.

Most, but not all, input classes have a corresponding output class.

A low-level stream connects directly with the source of the data.

A high-level stream is built on top of another stream using wrapping.

A class with Buffered in its name reads or writes data in groups of bytes or characters
and often improves performance in sequential file systems.

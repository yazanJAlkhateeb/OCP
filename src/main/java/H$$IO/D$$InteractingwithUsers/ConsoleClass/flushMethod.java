    The flush() method forces any buffered output to be written immediately. It is recommended that
you call the flush() method prior to calling any readLine() or readPassword() methods in order
to ensure that no data is pending during the read. Failure to do so could result in a user prompt for
input with no preceding text, as the text prior to the prompt may still be in a buffer.

    /*
    A File object often is initialized with String containing either an absolute or relative path
to the file or directory within the file system. The absolute path of a file or directory is the
full path from the root directory to the file or directory, including all subdirectories that
contain the file or directory. Alternatively, the relative path of a file or directory is the path
from the current working directory to file or directory. For example, the following is an
absolute path to the zoo.txt file:
/home/smith/data/zoo.txt
The following is a relative path to the same file, assuming the user’s current directory
was set to /home/smith .
data/zoo.txt
Different operating systems vary in their format of path names. For example, Unix-
based systems use the forward slash / for paths, whereas Windows-based systems use
the backslash \ character. That said, many programming languages and file systems
support both types of slashes when writing path statements. For convenience, Java
offers two options to retrieve the local separator character: a system property and a
static variable defined in the File class. Both of the following examples will output
the separator character:
System.out.println(System.getProperty("file.separator"));
System.out.println(java.io.File.separator);
The following code creates a File object and determines if the path it references exists
within the file system:*/
public static void main(String[] args) {
File file = new File("/home/smith/data/zoo.txt");
System.out.println(file.exists());
}
/*
This example uses the absolute path to a file and outputs true or false , depending on
whether the file exists. The most common File constructor we will use throughout this
chapter takes a single String as an argument representing the relative or absolute path.
There are other constructors, such as the one that joins an existing File path with
a relative child path, as shown in the following example:
*/
File parent = new File("/home/smith");
File child = new File(parent,"data/zoo.txt");
/*
In this example, we create a path that is equivalent to our previous example, using a
combination of a child path and a parent path. If the parent object happened to be null , then
it would be skipped and the method would revert to our single String constructor.

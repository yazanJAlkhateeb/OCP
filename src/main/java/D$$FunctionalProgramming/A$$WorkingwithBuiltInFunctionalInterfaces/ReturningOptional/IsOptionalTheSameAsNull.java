    /*Before Java 8, programmers would return null instead of Optional . There were a few
shortcomings with this approach. One was that there wasn’t a clear way to express that
null might be a special value. By contrast, returning an Optional is a clear statement in
the API that there might not be a value in there.
Another advantage of Optional is that you can use a functional programming style with
ifPresent() and the other methods rather than needing an if statement. Finally, you’ll
see toward the end of the chapter that you can chain Optional calls.*/

Description         Symbol
.                   A reference to the current directory
..                  A reference to the parent of the current directory



     For example, the path value ../bear.txt refers to a file named bear.txt in the parent
of the current directory. Likewise, the path value ./penguin.txt refers to a file named
penguin.txt in the current directory. These symbols can also be combined for greater
effect. For example, ../../lion.data refers to a file lion.data that is two directories up
from the current working directory.*/

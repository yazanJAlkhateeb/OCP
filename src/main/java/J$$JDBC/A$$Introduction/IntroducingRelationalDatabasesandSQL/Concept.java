    /*There are two main ways to access
a relational database from Java:
Java Database Connectivity Language (JDBC): Accesses data as rows and columns.
JDBC is the API covered in this chapter.

Java Persistence API (JPA): Accesses data through Java objects using a concept called
object-relational mapping (ORM). The idea is that you donâ€™t have to write as much
code, and you get your data in Java objects. JPA is not on the exam, and therefore it is
not covered in this chapter.

A relational database is accessed through Structured Query Language (SQL).
In addition to relational databases, there is another type of database called a NoSQL
database. This is for databases that store their data in a format other than tables.
NoSQL is out of scope for the exam as well.

In the following sections, we introduce a small relational database that we will be
using for the examples in this chapter and present the SQL to access it. We will also
cover some vocabulary that you need to know.*/

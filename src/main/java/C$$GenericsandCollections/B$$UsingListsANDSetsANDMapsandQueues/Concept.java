/*List : A list is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate entries. Elements
in a list can be accessed by an int index.

Set : A set is a collection that does not allow duplicate entries.

Queue : A queue is a collection that orders its elements in a specific order for processing.
A typical queue processes its elements in a first-in, first-out order, but other orderings
are possible.Using Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues


Map : A map is a collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed.
The elements in a map are key/value pairs.*/

/*The data structures that involve sorting do not allow null s.*/

/*Next comes ArrayDeque . You canâ€™t put null in an ArrayDeque because methods
like poll() use null as a special return value to indicate that the collection is empty.
Since null has that meaning, Java forbids putting a null in there. That would just be
confusing.*/

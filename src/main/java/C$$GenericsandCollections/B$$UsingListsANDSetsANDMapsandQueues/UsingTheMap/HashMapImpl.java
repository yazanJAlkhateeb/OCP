    /*stores the keys in a hash table. This means that it uses the hashCode() method
of the keys to retrieve their values more efficiently.
The main benefit is that adding elements and retrieving the element by key both have
constant time. The tradeoff is that you lose the order in which you inserted the elements.
Most of the time, you arenâ€™t concerned with this in a map anyway. If you were, you could
use LinkedHashMap .*/

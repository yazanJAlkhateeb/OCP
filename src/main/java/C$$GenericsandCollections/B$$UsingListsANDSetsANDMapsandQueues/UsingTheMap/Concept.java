    /*A Hashtable is like Vector in that it is really old and thread-safe and that you won’t be
expected to use it. It contains a lowercase t as a mistake from the olden days. All you have
to do is be able to pick it out in a lineup. In the form of old school analogies, ArrayList is
to Vector as HashMap is to Hashtable .*/

    /*Given that Map doesn’t extend Collection , there are more methods specified on the Map
interface. Since there are both keys and values, we need generic type parameters for both*/

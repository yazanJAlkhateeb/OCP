    /*A LinkedList is special because it implements both List and Queue . It has all of the
methods of a List . It also has additional methods to facilitate adding or removing from the
beginning and/or end of the list.
The main benefits of a LinkedList are that you can access, add, and remove from the
beginning and end of the list in constant time. The tradeoff is that dealing with an arbi-
trary index takes linear time. This makes a LinkedList a good choice when youâ€™ll be using
it as Queue .*/

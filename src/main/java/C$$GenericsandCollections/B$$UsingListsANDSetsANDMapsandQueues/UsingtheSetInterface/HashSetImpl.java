public class HashSetImpl {

    /*stores its elements in a hash table. This means that it uses the hashCode()
method of the objects to retrieve them more efficiently. If you forgot how hashCode()
works, please review Chapter 1, “Advanced Class Design.”
The main benefit is that adding elements and checking if an element is in the set both
have constant time. The tradeoff is that you lose the order in which you inserted the
elements. Most of the time, you aren’t concerned with this in a set anyway, making HashSet
the most common set.*/

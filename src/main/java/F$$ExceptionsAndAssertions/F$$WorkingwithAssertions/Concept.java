    /*An assertion is a Boolean expression that you place at a point in your code where you
expect something to be true.*/
    /*An assert statement
contains this statement along with an optional String message.*/

/*The syntax for an assert statement has two forms:
assert boolean_expression;
assert boolean_expression: error_message;*/

/*The three possible outcomes of an assert statement are as follows:
If assertions are disabled, Java skips the assertion and goes on in the code.

If assertions are enabled and the boolean expression is true , then our assertion has
been validated and nothing happens. The program continues to execute in its normal
manner.
If assertions are enabled and the boolean expression is false , then our assertion is
invalid and a java.lang.AssertionError is thrown.*/

/*Assertions are used for debugging purposes, allowing you to verify that something that
you think is true during the coding phase is actually true at runtime.*/

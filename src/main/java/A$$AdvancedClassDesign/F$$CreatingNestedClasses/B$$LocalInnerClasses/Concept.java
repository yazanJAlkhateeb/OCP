public class Concept {
/*A local inner class is a nested class defined within a method. Like local variables, a local
inner class declaration does not exist until the method is invoked, and it goes out of scope
when the method returns. This means that you can create instances only from within the
method. Those instances can still be returned from the method. This is just how local vari-
ables work. Local inner classes have the following properties:
■ They do not have an access specifier.
■ They cannot be declared static and cannot declare static fields or methods.
■ They have access to all fields and methods of the enclosing class.
■They do not have access to local variables of a method unless those variables are final
or effectively final. More on this shortly.*/

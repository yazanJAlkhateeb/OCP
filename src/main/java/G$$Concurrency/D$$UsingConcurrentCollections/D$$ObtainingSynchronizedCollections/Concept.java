    Besides the concurrent collection classes that we have covered, the Concurrency API also
includes methods for obtaining synchronized versions of existing non-concurrent collection
objects. These methods, defined in the Collections class, contain synchronized methods
that operate on the inputted collection and return a reference that is the same type as the
underlying collection.

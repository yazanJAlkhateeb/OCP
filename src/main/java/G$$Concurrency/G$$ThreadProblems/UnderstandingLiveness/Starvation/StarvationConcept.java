    /*
    Starvation occurs when a single thread is perpetually denied access to a shared resource
or lock. The thread is still active, but it is unable to complete its work as a result of other
threads constantly taking the resource that they trying to access.
In our fox example, imagine that we have a pack of very hungry, very competitive foxes
in our environment. Every time Foxy stands up to go get food, one of the other foxes sees her
and rushes to eat before her. Foxy is free to roam around the enclosure, take a nap, and howl
for a zookeeper but is never able to obtain access to the food. In this example, Foxy literally
and figuratively experiences starvation. Good thing that this is just a theoretical example!

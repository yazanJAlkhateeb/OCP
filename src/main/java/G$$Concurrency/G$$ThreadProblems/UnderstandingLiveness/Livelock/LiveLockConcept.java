    /*
    Livelock occurs when two or more threads are conceptually blocked forever, although they
are each still active and trying to complete their task. Livelock is a special case of resource
starvation in which two or more threads actively try to acquire a set of locks, are unable to
do so, and restart part of the process.
Livelock is often a result of two threads trying to resolve a deadlock. Returning to our
fox example, imagine that Foxy and Tails are both holding their food and water resources,
respectively. They each realize that they cannot finish their meal in this state, so they both
let go of their food and water, run to opposite side of the environment, and pick up the
other resource. Now Foxy has the water, Tails has the food, and neither is able to finish
their meal!
If Foxy and Tails continue this process forever, it is referred to as livelock. Both Foxy
and Tails are active, running back and forth across their area, but neither is able to finish
their meal. Foxy and Tails are executing a form of failed deadlock recovery. Each fox
notices that they are potentially entering a deadlock state and responds by releasing all of
its locked resources. Unfortunately, the lock and unlock process is cyclical, and the two
foxes are conceptually deadlocked.
In practice, livelock is often very difficult issue to detect. Threads in a livelock state appear
active and able to respond to requests, even when they are in fact stuck in an endless cycle.

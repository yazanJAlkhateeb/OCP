    Ambiguous Lambda Expressions: Callable vs. Supplier
You may remember from Chapter 4 that the Callable functional interface strongly
resembles the Supplier functional interface, in that they both take no arguments and
return a generic type. One difference is that the method in Callable can throw a checked
Exception . How do you tell lambda expressions for these two apart? The answer is
sometimes you can't. Consider the following example, which uses the same lambda
expression for three different method calls:
public class AmbiguousLambdaSample {
public static void useCallable(Callable<Integer> expression) {}Creating Threads with the ExecutorService
343
public static void useSupplier(Supplier<Integer> expression) {}
public static void use(Supplier<Integer> expression) {}
public static void use(Callable<Integer> expression) {}
public static void main(String[] args) {
useCallable(() -> {throw new IOException();}); // COMPILES
useSupplier(() -> {throw new IOException();}); // DOES NOT COMPILE
use(() -> {throw new IOException();});
// DOES NOT COMPILE
}
}
The first line of the main() method compiles, as Callable is permitted to throw checked
exceptions. The second line of the main() method does not compile, as Supplier does
not support checked exceptions.
What about the last line? The use() method is overloaded to take both Callable and
Supplier parameters. The compiler does not take into account the fact that the body of
the lambda expression happens to throw an exception; therefore, it does not know how
to tell them apart. As you might have already guessed, when the compiler doesnâ€™t know
what to do, it reports an error and does not compile. When the compiler is unable to
assign a functional interface to a lambda expression, it is referred to as an ambiguous
lambda expression.
Note that the ambiguity can be resolved with an explicit cast. For example, the following
corrected line of code does compile:
use((Callable<Integer>)() -> {throw new IOException("");});
// COMPILES
With an explicit cast, the lambda expression is no longer ambiguous and the compiler
can handle it without issue.

/*Problem How do we create an object in memory only once in an application and have it
shared by multiple classes?*/

/*Solution    The singleton pattern is a creational pattern focused on creating only one
instance of an object in memory within an application, sharable by all classes and threads
within the application. The globally available object created by the singleton pattern is
referred to as a singleton.*/

/*You might have noticed that we added the modifier synchronized to
addHay() , removeHay() , and getHayQuantity() . We will discuss these
concepts in more detail in Chapter 7 , “Concurrency.” For now, however,
you just need to know that they prevent two processes from running the
same method at the exact same time.*/

   /* In the previous example, we created a single instance of a Lemur object and accessed it via
    superclass and interface references. Once we changed the reference type, though, we lost
    access to more specific methods defined in the subclass that still exists within the object.
    We can reclaim those references by casting the object back to the specific subclass it came
    from:
    Primate primate = lemur;

    Lemur lemur2 = primate; // DOES NOT COMPILE

    Lemur lemur3 = (Lemur)primate;
System.out.println(lemur3.age);
*/
/*In this example, we first try to convert the primate reference back to a lemur reference,
lemur2, without an explicit cast. The result is that the code will not compile. In the second
example, though, we explicitly cast the object to a subclass of the object Primate, and we
gain access to all the methods available to the Lemur class.
Here are some basic rules to keep in mind when casting variables:
1. 	 Casting an object from a subclass to a superclass doesn’t require an explicit cast.
2. 	 Casting an object from a superclass to a subclass requires an explicit cast.
3. 	 The compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types.
4. 	 Even when the code compiles without issue, an exception may be thrown at runtime if
the object being cast is not actually an instance of that class.*/

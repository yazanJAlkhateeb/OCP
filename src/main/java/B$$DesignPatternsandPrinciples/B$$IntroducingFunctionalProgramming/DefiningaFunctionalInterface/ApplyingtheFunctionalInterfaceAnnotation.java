    /*While it is a good practice to mark a functional interface with the @FunctionalInterface
annotation for clarity, it is not required with functional programming. The Java compiler
implicitly assumes that any interface that contains exactly one abstract method is
a functional interface. Conversely, if a class marked with the @FunctionalInterface
annotation contains more than one abstract method, or no abstract methods at all, then
the compiler will detect this error and not compile.
One problem with not always marking your functional interfaces with this annotation is
that another developer may treat any interface you create that has only one method as
a functional interface. If you later modify the interface to have other abstract methods,
suddenly their code will break since it will no longer be a functional interface.
Therefore, it is recommend that you explicitly mark the interface with the
@FunctionalInterface annotation so that other developers know which interfaces they
can safely apply lambdas to without the possibility that they may stop being functional
interfaces down the road.
The exam writers arenâ€™t likely to use this annotation, as they expect you to be able to
determine whether an interface is a functional interface on your own.*/

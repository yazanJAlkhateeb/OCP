   /* You might wonder how a developer using the interface can build their code without
            access to a class that implements the interface. The developer using the interface can
create a temporary mock object, sometimes referred to as dummy code, which simulates
        the real object that implements the interface with a simple implementation. The mock
    object does not need to be very complex, with one line per abstract method, for example,
    as it only serves as a placeholder for the real implementation. This allows the developer
    using the interface to compile, run, and test their code.
    For example, imagine that you were working on a racing application with the code that
    calculates the winners handled by a different team. Both your team and the other team52
    Chapter 2  ■   Design Patterns and Principles
    agreed on a RaceManager interface, as shown in the following code, with your team
    using the interface and the other team implementing it:
    public class Animal {}
    public class Tortoise extends Animal {}
    public class Hare extends Animal {}
    public interface RaceManager {
        public Animal getWinner(List<Animal> animals);
    }
    The good news is that your team has finished its part of the project first. The bad news
    is that the other team has nothing for you to test with. While waiting for the other team
    to finish, you can create a mock version of the RaceManager class, as shown in the
    following sample code:
    public class DummyRaceManager implements RaceManager {
        public Animal getWinner(List<Animal> animals) {
            return animals==null || animals.size()==0 ? null: animals.get(0);
        }
    }
    The code isn’t particularly intelligent; after all it just returns the first item in the list,
    but it is useful for testing purposes because it allows your team to execute your code
while the other team finishes their implementation. You could also write a version that
    always returns Tortoise or Hare. The goal is just to give you something temporary
    that you can work with and that allows your code to compile, regardless of whether it
    works exactly as expected. After all, the full implementation of getWinner() could be
    hundreds of lines long and based on very complex business rules.
